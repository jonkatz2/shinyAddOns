\description{
Generate names composed of random characters and numbers. There is no guarantee names won't collide, but they are guaranteed to start with a letter. The ratio of letters to LETTERS to numbers should be pretty close to even (26:26:30).
}
\note{
Kind of similar to \code{basename(tempfile("",""))}, but less rigorous and not hex based.
